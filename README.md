# CommandStation Library
Arduino library for controlling and powering devices on a two-wire bus. Based on DCC++ EX (https://github.com/DCC-EX/BaseStation-EX) for controlling model railroad including trains and accessories, but has other uses including home automation. Special thanks to Gregg E. Bermann, who wrote the original DCC++ sketches.

To include this library in your platformIO project, add https://github.com/davidcutting42/CommandStation.git to ```lib_deps``` and add ```#include <CommandStation.h>``` to your ```main.cpp``` file. See the example for usage.
